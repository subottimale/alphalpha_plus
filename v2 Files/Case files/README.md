**Stacked Case**
<br />You can just cut Fat Stacks, if you won't be using RBG
<br />Thin Stack files are designed to facilitate access to the RGB breakout on the right side of the pcb

Regardless of what kind of stacks you cut, max height on top of pcb is 6mm. Max height on bottom is up to you

Full size setup assembly (o-rings optional but recommended): 
<br />20mm screw
<br />plate
<br />plate
<br />o-ring
<br />pcb
<br />o-ring
<br />plate
<br />plate
<br />plate
<br />nut

Slim assemlby uses 18mm screws and one less plate on the bottom

**3DP Case**
<br />Assembly: just screw the pcb to the case. Maybe use some o-rings. Also maybe use some self-tapping screws to start the threads
