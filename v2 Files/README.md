This iteration adds a new bottom row option (1, 2, 2, 1) and a mondo flex cut above the exploded space bar section

If you've gone absolutely mad enough to order this, you'll need: 36 diodes (14N4148 SOD123), pro micro or equivalent, M2 hardware (4 @ 4-6mm for 3dp case, 4-8 @ 18-20mm for stacked case). Optional: o-rings for isolation (2mm OD, 1.5mm ID work well). Oh and you should really get yourself some pro micro sockets and millmax pins, if you can swing 'em

If you use JLC, the dimensions aren't picked up for some reason, so here ya go: (H x W) 86.4mm x 190.5mm

Stacked edge case and top-mounted shell case files are available...somewhere...else...in this repo

I've only had the shell done in MJF. If you're printing yourself, typical PLA print appears to work fine

I highly recommend some amont of isolation mounting for moar fun. Burger for the stacked case, single set of rings between pcb and 3dp case
