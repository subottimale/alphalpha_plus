This iteration adds new bottom row options (http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/7b2dbd502e5ef98d23a2ff15da0d303e) and a mondo flex cut above the exploded space bar section

If you've gone absolutely mad enough to order this, you'll need: 36 diodes (14N4148 SOD123), pro micro or equivalent, M2 hardware (4-8 heatset inserts, 4 @ 4-6mm for 3dp case, 4-8 @ 18-20mm for stacked case). Optional: o-rings for isolation (2mm OD, 1.5mm ID work well). Oh and you should really get yourself some pro micro sockets and millmax pins, if you can swing 'em

If you use JLC, the dimensions aren't picked up for some reason, so here ya go: (H x W) 86.4mm x 190.5mm

Stacked edge plate, top-mounted shell, and tray case files are available...somewhere...else...in this repo

PLA prints works fine for these cases, but I highly recommend MJF or SLS for a more upscale feel

I highly recommend some amont of isolation mounting for moar fun. Burger for the stacked case, single set of rings between pcb and 3dp tray case
