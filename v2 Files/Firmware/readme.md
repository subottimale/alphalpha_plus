You will need to run this board locally. You won't find it in the configurator
<br />
<br />If you're going the cli route, the default keymap is what I use on a daily basis. It is set up with rgb, mousekeys, combos, and some custom code
<br />
<br />Vial firmware for Alphalpha+ v2 is available, thanks to HaiZeus
<br />
<br />Ready-made hex's are in the Vial folder in this repository: file marked "norgb" disables rgb and enables mouse keys. A RP2040 file is now available, a well.
<br />
<br />If you're using an rgb strip, please note the orientation. Depending on the strip you use, the voltage and ground may be reversed. The header is ordered V D G, but some strips are ordered G D V. Double-check and wire accordingly!
