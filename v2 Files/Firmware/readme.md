You will need to run this board locally. You won't find it in the configurator
<br />
<br />If you're going the cli route, the default keymap is what I use on a daily basis. It is set up with rgb, mousekeys, combos, and some custom code
<br />
<br />Vial firmware for Alphalpha+ v2 is available, thanks to u/HaiZeus0411 
<br />
<br />Source can be found here: https://github.com/HaiZeus0411/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards%2Fhaizeus%2Falphalpha_plus
<br />
<br />Ready-made hex's are in the Vial folder in this repository: file marked "norgb" disables rgb and enables mouse keys
