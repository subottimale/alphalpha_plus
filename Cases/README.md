3DP CASE

Base is totally optional, I've run it with just the top and some bumpons.

Also optional are o-rings between pcb and case. I used what was on-hand, but have't done extensive testing to recommend specific products.

STACKED CASE

Left & Right side files are provided for materials where there may be difference in surface finish between top and bottom, i.e. metal. Otherwise, files are identical
